# Portfolio page for Loukas Piloidis
This is my official portfolio page. The page is minimalistic, according to my taste, hope you like it :)
I tried to include information that is not available in my other platforms like linkedIn.

# Tech stack
No big surprises here, as it is only a static front end website. I use React and deployed it on github pages. The reason for React is because it's a very powerful, fast, and modern technology for frontend. As for the deployment method, since most of my projects are deployed on Heroku, I wanted to have a bit of variety and experience with another tool. Since its nature is frontend only, github pages is an ideal place to host it.
